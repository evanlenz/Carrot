To use the MarkLogic test script:

  1. Create an HTTP app server pointing to the
     top-level Carrot directory.

This is not properly a test script yet, just an invocation
script, with which you can invoke:

 - just the parser,
 - just the parser and compiler, or
 - the parser, compiler, and execute the result.
 
See the comments at the top of test.xqy in this directory for example uses.
